Summary:
Using reinforcement learning to train attackers to target suboptimal defenders (nearsighted / farsighted).

This project has been ongoing since September 2018, under the supervision of Professor [Lucia Moura](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lucia/), and Professor [Yongyi Mao](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~yymao/index_main.html).

The project will also fulfill the requirements of the [CSI 4900 - Honours Project](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~afelty/csi4900/) course.


This [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02301) is the original inspiration for the project.
